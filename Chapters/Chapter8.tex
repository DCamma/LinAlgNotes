\chapter{Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors}
Consider a vector space $V$ and a linear mapping $A:V\to V$
\begin{definition}
A vector $\vv\in V$, $\vv\not=0$ is called an eigenvector of $A$, of there exists scalar $\lambda$, such that $A\vv = \lambda\vv$. This scalar $\lambda$ is called an eigenvalue, corresponding to eigenvector $\vv$
\end{definition}
