This document aims to be a small example of how to transcribe the Linear Algebra notes, so to keep a consistency among sections written by different people.

\section{File structure}
The project is organized in the following way:
\begin{Verbatim}[obeytabs,tabsize=4]
Chapters
	Chapter1.tex
	Chapter2.tex
	. . .
Other
	CustomEnvironments.tex
	Sample.pdf
	Sample.tex
	packages.tex
README.md
RawMaterial
	Core.pdf
	Lecture_17_03_2015.pdf
	. . .
main.pdf
main.tex
\end{Verbatim}

If you need to add files (for example chapter files) please keep the same folder structure. 
\section{Available commands}
There are a few environments available for you to use, these allow you to apply custom styles without too much effort. These include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item definition
\item notation
\item example
\item lemma
\item properties
\end{itemize}
In order to see exactly what they do, and to have a more complete overview of the helper methods, take a look at \verb+Other/CustomEnvironments.tex+\\

These are quite easy to use, for example if you were to write a definition you can simply write the following:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{definition}
Some kind of definition. This definition also includes some math:
\[
\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}i^2
\]	
\end{definition}
\end{verbatim}
This code will produce the following output:
\begin{definition}
Some kind of definition. This definition also includes some math:
\[
\sum\limits_{i=0}^{n}i^2
\]	
\end{definition}
\section{Packages}
Packages are all contained in the file \verb+Other/packages.tex+. If you need to include a package, add it there. Please keep packages to a minimum, and include if and only if there is no other way to do a certain thing.
\section{Styling}
So as to keep the style consistent, please use the following pointers when typing:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Math mode and inline mode have to be used in a logical way. It is up to you when to use what, but look at the other chapters and keep it consistent.
\item Mathmode has to be activated using \verb+\[...\]+, not \verb+$$...$$+. This is due to some internal issues with how \LaTeX~handles math mode when used with the dollar signs.
\item 
\end{itemize}
